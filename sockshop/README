While results using SockShop demo application[1] are not shown in the paper, we have run some experiments with Sock Shop. Unfortunately,
the application itself is not mature enough to run reliable tests with consistent results. However, most of the code developed
can be used in case the application becomes more stable and mature for rerunning our experiments.
